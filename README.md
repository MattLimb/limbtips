# Limb.Tips

This respoitory is designed for tracking all the changes, improvements and new additions to the Limb.Tips website. 

## Why?

As a aspiring Python Developer, I have found myself wanting to write one-off tools just for the challenge of writing them, or to learn a new package/technology. This leads to a lot of code cluttering up my hard-drives not doing a whole lot. As such, I have decided to write this website, with Python in the back-end (obvs), to display some of these learnings as useful tools to other people, and as a small blog which will allow me to share these new learnings, problems and solutions, and occasionally allow me to setup my soapbox and shout into the void!

At the current time, this site is wildly incomplete, and it is not being hosted anywhere yet. I plan on setting up some hosting in the near future, when I have added a few new tools, and completed the Blog backbone.

## What can it do?

Primarilly this site will host a variety of tools. Currently the following have been developed:

- DNS Query

More will be on the way!
